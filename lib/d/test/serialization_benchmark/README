Thrift Serialization Benchmark
==============================

This directory contains an implementation of the mini
serialization benchmark also available for C++ and Java.

For meaningful results, you might want to make sure that
the Thrift library is compiled with release build flags,
e.g. by including the source files with the build instead
of linking libthriftd:

dmd -w -O -release -inline -I../../../../lib/d/src -Igen-d
-ofbenchmark $(find ../../src/thrift -name '*.d')
gen-d/DebugProtoTest_types.d benchmark.d
