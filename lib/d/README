Testing
=======

D support in Thrift is covered by two sets of tests: first,
the unit test blocks contained in the D source files, and
second, the more extensive testing applications in the test/
subdirectory, which also make use of the Thrift compiler.
Both are built when running "make check", but only the
unit tests are immediately run, however â€“ the separate test
cases typically run longer or require manual intervention.
It might also be prudent to run the independent tests,
which typically consist of a server and a client part,
against the other language implementations.
